    <!--<string name="love_g"><b>Nishith</b>\nAn offbeat arranged cum love marriage. Our parents had allowed to meet each other without any formal meeting. I had just arrived from Rome after training and had relocated to Mumbai for work, she was in the last phase of completing her PHD in Space science. It was so meticulously planned that my first date started with the Blessing of the almighty. I had to meet her after the morning 09.00 am mass on 10th july at Panvel. I was so eager to meet a mallu girl, who had left her family and most important Kerala to follow her dreams. She was a stallion beauty dressed in black and her wits of a mature woman had already impressed me. I took her to McDonald\'s to have a regular chat and to introduce myself. She had quietly heard all my views, aspirations and career goals with just a sip of coffee.  For me Neethal resembles my mom\'s beauty, my dad\â€™s intelligence and the most important the brother\'s charismatic thinking towards life.</string>
    <string name="love_b"><b>Neethal</b>\nI met Nishu for the first time after a morning Sunday mass in Mumbai. It was an unofficial meeting where we could spend enough time to sit and talk to each other over a cup of coffee. Nishu is a very jovial person and my meetings with him were always plesant as I never realized how time passed by talking to him. Listening to him I could feel that he is looking for someone who has her own dreams and passions in life, which really impressed me. More importantly over past few months I was realizing that he wants me to be what I am which made me more comfortable and feel natural being with him. Remembering a famous quote from  \'The Alchemist\', I must say \'I feel the entire universe conspired to help me find you\'.</string>

    <string name="vow_g"><b>Harsh</b>\nI would like to see her blossom in her career and family life. Every phase of her memory should be enlightened with the presence of near and dear ones. Dream of coming back to our home town after experiencing the world is my final goal in life. A journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step. I vow to lead her with love and happiness. There is old sailors saying \'A ship in harbor is safe, but that is not what ships are built for\'. Life is unpredictable. I feel confident that you will be a part in our sadness, sacrifices, downfalls and hard time</string>
<string name="vow_b"><b>Dixita</b>\nI Vow to walk with you in all thick and thins of life and to back you in your personal and professional life. I simply want to see you happy and embrace each moment of life with you.</string>
